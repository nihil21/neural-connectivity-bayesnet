# neural-connectivity-bayesnet
In this project I investigate the possibility of modelling neural connectivity from functional magnetic resonance images using Bayesian Networks.

All the experiments and results are shown in the Jupyter notebook [src/neural-connectivity-bayesnet.ipynb](src/neural-connectivity-bayesnet.ipynb).
